# Project Summary
The project is a simple scouting system designed for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). It enables teams to efficiently collect and analyze data during competitions, facilitating better strategy and performance evaluation. The goal is to enhance the existing system to support network traffic from an average of 20 concurrent users submitting data.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules, including:
- **Views**: Components for different screens in the application, such as Home, Export, InfoViewer, and scouting interfaces (PitScout, QuickScout).
- **Assets**: Contains images and other static files used in the application.
- **Server**: Handles backend logic and data processing.
- **Library**: Includes utility functions for file storage and data management.
